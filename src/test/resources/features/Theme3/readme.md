The project consists of the following components:
- **Capability 1**: A web-based user interface built with React and Redux.

#### Table

| Name | Age | Gender |
|------|-----|--------|
| John | 25  | Male   |
| Jane | 30  | Female |

This table shows a simple example of how to use markdown formatting in a README file. The first row of the table defines the column headers, and the subsequent rows define the data.
